# Blind Coding Challenge

## Overview
The **Blind Coding Challenge** is a static webpage where users attempt to type code without being able to see their input. The page is split into two halves:
- **Left Side:** Displays an image or a code snippet.
- **Right Side:** Contains a hidden text input field where users type.

After typing, users click the **'Submit'** button, and the page calculates how many lines of the typed code match the image.

---

## Features
- **Dual-Panel Layout:** The left half displays a reference image/snippet, and the right half is where users type blindly.
- **Hidden Input:** Users cannot see their input while typing, adding to the challenge.
- **Matching:** The script compares the typed text with the image content to calculate accuracy.
- **Score Calculation:** Displays the percentage of matching lines after submission.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the page.
- **JavaScript:** To handle text input, submission, and line matching logic.
